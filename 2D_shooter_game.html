                <p>The primary objective of this project was to create an engaging 2D shooter game that offered multiplayer functionality. It was a part of my college's Non Exam Assessment (NEA) and served as a practical application of the programming concepts I had learned. <br><br>
                    As Python was the first language I learned in college, I used my growing proficiency to implement the game's core mechanics, such as character movement, shooting mechanics, and game physics. I also utilized Python's libraries to handle networking and multiplayer functionality, allowing players to connect and compete with each other in real-time. <br><br>
                    Developing this game presented various challenges, including synchronizing game states across multiple players, ensuring fair gameplay, and optimizing performance. Overcoming these challenges required a deep understanding of Python and software development principles, and it allowed me to further hone my problem-solving skills.</p>
